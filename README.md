### CSS optimization

> _Note:_ This is done automatically on GitHub [using an Action](./.github/workflows/uncss.yaml)

In order to create a CSS file with only the neccessary styles, we use [`uncss`](https://github.com/uncss/uncss).

    npm ci
    npx uncss http://127.0.0.1:4000/20/dev.html > 20/theme.uncss.css

You can test the result on <http://localhost:4000/20/>.

## Edit Images

Images are stored on the [Sanity.io](https://sanity.io) CDN, you need to run the Studio to edit images. The instructions are in the [Adacon Sanity Studio](https://github.com/tech-women/adacon-sanity.git).
